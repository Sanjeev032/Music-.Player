# Music-.Player
This project is a part of my frontend development practice and aims to deliver an engaging user experience through a browser-based music player. It’s designed with a clean interface and responsive layout, ensuring usability across devices.

The player allows users to:

🎧 Play and pause songs

⏭️ Skip to next or previous tracks

📊 View and control playback progress

🔊 Adjust volume

💡 Enjoy a smooth and minimal UI/UX
